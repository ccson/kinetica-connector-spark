Kinetica Spark Connector
========================

The purpose of the Kinetica Spark connector is to perform massive parallel 
ingest into Kinetica via Dataset for Spark 2.x.  All interactions with the 
connector are through the SparkKineticaLoader API which is exposed inside 
the connector jar gpudb-spark-2.2.0-uber.jar.

This project uses Spark 2.2.0.
